README file for compThresh program

Sharlee Climer

This program computes the expression thresholds corresponding to x% high- 
and x% low-expression values. The usage can be found by typing 'compThresh' 
on the command line:

$ ./compThresh 

Fatal: Usage:
  compThresh input.gex numInd numGenes percent

'input.gex' is the input gene expression data file.  It is assumed
that there are NUMHEADROWS header rows and NUMHEADCOLS header columns
in this file (as defined in compThresh.h).  Each gene is represented by a
row in this input file, and each column represents an individual, time
step, etc.


'numInd' is the number of individuals in the data set and 'numGenes'
is the number of genes.

'percent' is the percentage of expression values that you desire for 
labeling as high or low, respectively. For example, if 25 is input, 
the high- and low-thresholds computed will correspond to values that
have 25% of the expression values above and below, respectively, and
50% of the values will be lie between these two values.
